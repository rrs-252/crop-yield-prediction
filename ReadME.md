# Crop Yield Prediction Pipeline
This repository provides a modular, extensible pipeline for predicting crop yields using both deep learning and traditional machine learning models. The project is organized for clarity, scalability, and ease of use, following best practices in Python and PyTorch development.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Automated loading, cleaning, and scaling of input features.

Deep Learning Models: Includes advanced architectures such as DeepFusionNN and CNNLSTM (PyTorch).

Traditional Models: Supports Random Forest and XGBoost regressors.

Unified Training & Evaluation: Consistent training loops and evaluation metrics for all models.

Comprehensive Metrics: Calculates MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, R², Adjusted R², and more.

Rich Visualizations: Generates comparison plots, training curves, actual vs. predicted scatter plots, and error distributions.

Modular Codebase: Each functionality is encapsulated in its own module for easy maintenance and extension.
